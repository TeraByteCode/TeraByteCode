### Hi there 👋 I'm Victor

🔭 I’m currently working on Latschbacher AG. I am responsible for programming and support. I advise our customers, clarify the requirements and check the technical feasibility. Thanks to my solution-oriented way of thinking, I often manage to find a good solution for the customer, the administrator as well as the programmers.
